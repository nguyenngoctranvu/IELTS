# An actity you did that you think was wasted of time

You should say:

```
  * What it was
  * When you did it
  * Why you did it and explain why you think it wasted your time
```

1. Well, I think I am going to share with you about the time that I unintentionally wasted my time on the Internet

2. Let's start with when it happened, well, it was just a couple of days ago when I was swamped with my duties and had to, literally, burn the candles at both ends to get things done. At that night, so frazzled was I that I decided to drop off to bed earlier than I should have, promising myself that I would wake up a bit earlier in the next morning to make up for my procrastination

3. However, things got messed up when I kept tossing and turning on my bed and started to watch some short video clips on Facebook. For your information, they were all summarized versions of several blockbusters of all times, which happened to easily cast a spell on a movie lover like me, I mean, I just kept binge-watching the whole list, one after another, until 3 or 4 am.

4. Talking about my feelings after I let the time pass by inanely, honestly, you can't imagine how regretful and inconsolable I felt later on the next morning. You know, I still had to wake up at 8 am as planned and I was like dead on my feet the whole morning, keeping mind-wandering about what I could have done with the time span I had wasted. I wasn't myself at all at that time because as usual, I would definitely not do such pointless stuff.
