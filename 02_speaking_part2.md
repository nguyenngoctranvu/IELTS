picturesque, sleep village
dramatic moutain scenery.
cosmopolitan place
stunning beaches
fascinating place
pretty similar

Mostly, we went hiking in the hills and mountains nearby. We also just hung out in the village, playing cards and eating.

We did some sightseeing in BangKok, the Grand Place, Wat Pho and so on. Then we hit the beaches in Krabi for some sun, swimming, and cocktails!

We went on a walking tour of the center and the Vatican. Mostly, we went to restaurants and cafes and sampled as much of the local cuisine as we could fit in our stomachs!

We stayed in a very nice village surrounded by nine mountaint scenery

We stayed in a very picturesque, sleepy village surrounded by some dramatic mountain scenery.

Bangkok is a very cosmopolitan place but it could be a little overwhelming because there was so much going on! Then we went to Krabi, which has some stunning beaches.

It's a fascinating place but it's quite touristy, too. The best thing was food, which was out of this world.

It was relaxing but by the end, I was getting quite bored, because each day was pretty similar.

I loved Krabi, because it was like nowhere I'd ever been before. I wasn't so keen on Bangkok. It's a cool place but it's a bit big and noisy for my tastes.

I wasn't so keen on the museums. I didn't think they were very interesting.

It's a nice area, but it's too developed and touristy for my tastes.

I think I liked the general atmosphere most of all. Walking around the little streets in the center felt like being in an old film. I wish it had been less crowded, though.

I wish we hadn't stayed in that awful hotel.

1. I went to Thailand with a group of friends for ten days. We did some sightseeing in Bangkok, the Grand Palace, Wat Pho and so on. Then we hit the beaches in Krabi for some sun, swimming, and cocktails. Bangkok is a very cosmopolitan place but it could be a little overwhelming because there was so much going on! Krabi has some stunning beaches, and I loved it there because it was like nowhere I'd ever been before. On the other hand, I wasn't so keen on Bangkok. It's a cool place but it's a bit big and noisy for my tastes.

2. I went to Da Lat by myself for three weeks. I traveled around, did something hiking and camping, and explored the countryside. I was near Lake Hoang Tuyen, which is a huge lake with mountains, and villages dotted around the sides. It was beautiful in a wild way, and the emptiness gave me a real feeling of isolation and solitude. I liked the people I met, everyone was so open and welcoming. On the other hand, even though it was summer, the nights were so cold! I wish I'd taken a warmer sleeping bag.
