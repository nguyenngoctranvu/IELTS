G1: 1990
G2: 2010
O: Lots of changes. Power generators.

The maps illustrate the changes of the same area in Someland over a 20 year period.

Overall, we can see a lot of developments in this area over the given time show. We can see a lot of structures have been repurposed over the 20 years to generate power and electricity.

In 1990, a river ran straight through the middle of the map, from south to north. To the northwest of the map, a forest area, and mountain exist. Slightly south of this, an ancient structure was built and still stands. To the northeast, once again, a mountainous area exists. South of this we can see farmlands and a small village to the east of this.

By 2010, we can see many developments. The river still runs from the south but stops halfway up the map as a hydroelectric dam has been constructed. To the west of the river, just south of the dam, power stations have been erected. To the east, we can also see some power stations as well as a new village area that has been added. A large lake was added to the north of the dam, and we can see sailing boats and fish here, too. The farmlands and villages were removed, and a hotel was developed on this area of the map.
